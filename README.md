# 🎮 Real-Time Gesture Recognition for Interactive Gaming

A computer vision–based interactive gaming system that allows players to control gameplay using **hand gestures in real time** through a standard webcam — eliminating the need for physical controllers.

This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Pygame** to deliver an immersive, touch-free gaming experience.
